# Week14-EatDaTaco
Living in Austin, where the official dish of the city is a bag of tacos, I went ahead and modified the assignment from EatDaBurger to be EatDaTaco.

This application uses a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. 

It is a very simple application that allows the user to type a taco into a text field, and then upon clicking the submit button, the taco appears on their plate (on the left side of the page). Click on the "Devour" button by the taco, and that taco will appear on the Devoured taco list (on the right side of the page).

## Dependencies
This application requires Express, Express-Handlebars, Method-Override, Body-Parser, MySQL, and EJS.

Running `$ npm install` on the command line will install these dependencies.


This application is deployed on Heroku at:
